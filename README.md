# Moving balls


### What the project does?
The project displays balls moving on the screen and bouncing of off the walls


### Why the project is useful
It teaches how to manipulate CSS styles with Javascript programming. In addition to the original requirement 
I added various sizes to the balls and variable velocity depending on their size; once the ball hits the wall it 
also has its color changed.


### Installation/How to run
The contents of the project needs to be placed on the web-server to make it available on the Internet, otherwise no need for any installation, just open index.html in your browser


### Usage
Clone the repo and open locally index.html in your browser, no need to install or configure anything else.


### Roadmap of future improvements
Curently I do not plan any further activities in this repository.
